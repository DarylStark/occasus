# Occasus - application configuration for Python applications

Occasus is going to be a easy-to-use configuration tool for Python applications. By using Pydantic models, the user can specify how configuration should look like and what fields there are. The end-user of the application can overwrite this configuration if needed. As of right now, this is still in development phase.
